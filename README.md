## Topic and goals 

I wanted to get an answer for a party of people, who want to go somewhere for having fun and enjoy the slopes but don't know where to go. We get as result, variables as important as price, Kilometres which has the slopes and freeride there are in each resort.

## Getting Started 

There are some dataset which I working out them for getting in shape with my topic.
In addition, I scrapped skiresort.info and I got some in depth values, which I will use ahead. 

1. Analize all worldwide's ski resorts 
2. I get best data of the prev analysis, as result; I just get North America and Europe
3. I determine which has more Freeride Kms and which has better rates. 


## Conclusion

We have seen how the Kms are distributed by diferent Countries, where there are a top of 5 Countries, which are the USA, Italy, Switzerland,                Austria and France. They have the majority of Kms along the world.
         
We know that the countries which have most of the Kms of freeride are Austria and the USA, and which are the best Ski resort for do freeride.
         
In Addition, we have gotten, that the USA the highest prices, but is also the best quality as ski resort. Related all I know we can say the USA is          the best Country for doing skiing, as well in resort as well in freeride.
