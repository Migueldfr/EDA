SKI RESORT 

He analizado datos sobre las estaciones de esqui en el mundo, para relacionar unos continentes entre otros y sacar conclusiones.

He querido dar respuesta a un planteamiento habitual de grupos de jovenes que quieren ir a alguna estacion de esqui pero no saben donde ir. Ya que este analisis da como resultado , variables tan importantes como el precio, los kilometros que tienen las pistas y los fuera de pistas que hay en cada resort.

      * ### 7. Distribution of Rates

      * ### 8. Distribution of Freeride along all Countries

# 4. Conclusion

         We have seen how the Kms are distributed by diferent Countries, where there are a top of 5 Countries, which are the USA, Italy, Switzerland,                Austria and France. They have the majority of Kms along the world.
         
         We know that the countries which have most of the Kms of freeride are Austria and the USA, and which are the best Ski resort for do freeride.
         
         In Addition, we have gotten, that the USA the highest prices, but is also the best quality as ski resort. Related all I know we can say the USA is          the best Country for doing skiing, as well in resort as well in freeride.
